It was the advent of the mass-produced and affordable Ford Model T that truly disrupted the transportation market \[2\].

Another misconception is the "technology mudslide hypothesis," the idea that companies fail because they don't keep up technologically. The sources explain that well-managed companies are often aware of disruptive innovations but may initially choose not to pursue them because they are not profitable enough at first or because their development could divert resources from sustaining innovations necessary for competing in existing markets \[5\].

Types of Disruptive Innovation

The sources distinguish between two main types of disruptive innovation:

● Low-End Disruption: Targets customers at the bottom of the market who are satisfied with "good enough" products at lower prices. The disruptor focuses on serving this less-demanding segment and gradually improves product quality, eventually moving upmarket and challenging incumbents in more profitable segments \[6, 7\].

● New-Market Disruption: Creates a new market by addressing the needs of customers who were previously unserved by existing products or services. The sources point out that new market disruption often involves offering a different set of values that redefine the industry over time as the disruptor penetrates the market and attracts customers from the existing market \[6, 8\].

Strategies for Established Companies

Established companies can navigate the challenges of disruptive innovation by adopting several strategies:

● Develop a deep understanding of disruptive innovation theory: By recognizing the patterns and principles of disruption, companies can better anticipate and respond to potential threats.

● Create separate units to focus on disruptive innovations: This allows companies to explore new opportunities without being constrained by the values and processes of their core business.

● Foster a culture of innovation and experimentation: Encourage employees to generate new ideas, take risks, and learn from failures. This can involve establishing internal incubators, hackathons, or other programs that support experimentation and rapid prototyping.

● Acquire disruptive startups: By acquiring promising startups, established companies can gain access to new technologies and talent.
